# Authelia template

This template contains a skeleton Authelia configuration for use with a sqlite file. It was taken from [Florian Mueller's excellent Blog article](https://florianmuller.com/setup-authelia-bare-metal-with-openid-and-cloudflare-tunnel-on-a-hardened-proxmox-lxc-ubuntu-22-04-lts-container#configureauthelia) and modified and simplified for generic use.
