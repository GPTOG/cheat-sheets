# Marc's code snippets

I've written quite an amount of code in my life - some beautiful, some ugly.
I started my programming life at the age of 15 with BASIC on my Commodore 64, then moved to PASCAL, did some C and C++, java, loved PERL a lot, did a lot of Windows scripts (before there was Powershell), programmed a couple of iOS apps in objective C (Phew!!), did some C# (yeah, quite OK), as much as I hate Java ( I am probably too stupid for it), I LOVE javascript - it's flexible and easy and just recently discovered python which is really nice (the TAB key is your friend ;-) Did I say I do a lot of bash scripting ?

I'll just stuff everything that I consider more or less useful in here over time. Feel free to use it. I spare you the old stuff ;-)
