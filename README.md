over the years I have created a lot of scripts and notes (handwritten and digital) - at this point I thought - why not share it with the world? This repository contains

- code snippets
- ansible playbooks
- notes to lookup networking solutions
- notes around Proxmox
- notes around OpenWrt

## This is work in progress

as of July 2022, many of these folders may be empty still. I am constantly working on collecting the data and will push as soon as something compelling is added. Just need some time to aggregate everything. Some of these snippets might be duplicate in my other github repos 

## Use at your own Risk ;-)

Chaps, products change, and I am only human - there might be errors in the scripts, the infos may be outdated and so on - I am providing the information here as-is, for free, but use at your own risk ;-)
